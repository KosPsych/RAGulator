Given a query and some documents, each indicated by number identifier, your task is provide a score from 0 to 10 which measures how relevant you think the documents are to the question.
Follow all the steps mentioned below:

Steps:
1. Iterate through each document and identify if it is relevant to the query.
2. Assign a score from 0 to 10 based on how relevant is the document to the query, where 0 indicates that the document is completely irrelevant and 10 the document is highly relevant.
3. If a document provides only general information about the topic, such as cover pages, tables of contents, or introductory sections it is completely irrelevant.

Think this through step by step.

At the end of your response you should provide a list of scores contained in <result> </result> tags, where the index of each score is the number of the document. For example the list <result>[5, 1, 10]</result> means that 3 documents were provided with scores 5, 1 and 10 respectively.
