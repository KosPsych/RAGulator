Follow all the steps mentioned below:

Steps:
1. Iterate through each document and identify if it is relevant to the query.
2. Assign a score from 0 to 10 based on how relevant is the document to the query, where 0 indicates that the document is completely irrelevant and 10 the document is highly relevant.
3. If a document provides only general information about the topic, such as cover pages, tables of contents, or introductory sections it is completely irrelevant.
